# Part 2: Write queries

# Get the brand with the **id** of 8.
1. Brand.query.get(8)

# Get all models with the **name** Corvette and the **brand_name** Chevrolet.
2. Model.query.filter_by(name = 'Corvette', brand_name='Chevrolet').all()

# Get all models that are older than 1960.
3. Model.query.filter(Model.year < 1960).all()

# Get all brands that were founded after 1920.
4. Brand.query.filter(Brand.founded > 1920).all()

# Get all models with names that begin with "Cor".
5. Model.query.filter(Model.name.like('Cor%')).all()

# Get all brands with that were founded in 1903 and that are not yet discontinued.
6. Brand.query.filter(Brand.founded == 1903, Brand.discontinued == None).all()

# Get all brands with that are either discontinued or founded before 1950.
7. Brand.query.filter(db.or_(Brand.founded < 1950, Brand.discontinued == None)).all()

# Get any model whose brand_name is not Chevrolet.
    Model.query.filter(Model.brand_name.isnot('Chevrolet')).all()

# Part 3: Discussion Questions (Include your answers as comments.)

# 1. What is the returned value and datatype of ``Brand.query.filter_by(name='Ford')``?

# My Answer = 
# >>> answer = Brand.query.filter_by(name='Ford')
# >>> type(answer)
# <class 'flask_sqlalchemy.BaseQuery'>

#My Answer = Returned Value: This will return all vehicles that are the brand name Ford

# 2. In your own words, what is an association table, and what *type* of relationship
# does an association table manage?

# My Answer: 
# An association table is one that links one table to another. There is no new 
# data presented in that table.
# It is just a way for one to reach through from one table to another. 
# An association table manages foreign keys
